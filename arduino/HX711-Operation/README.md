# Load cell with HX711 - Operation
- The code is set for daily operation of the load cell with HX711 amplifier. 
- The [HX-711 library](//https://github.com/RobTillaart/HX711) is required to run the code
- Need to run [HX711-Calibration](arduino/HX711-Calibration), note down the scale coefficient and offset before running this normal operation.
